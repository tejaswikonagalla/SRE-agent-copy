I'm sorry, but the error you're encountering is not related to the `alembic.ini` file. The error is due to an incorrect import statement in your Python code, specifically an "attempted relative import beyond top-level package" error. This typically occurs when using relative imports in a way that goes beyond the intended package structure.

To fix this, you need to adjust the import statements in your Python files. Here's how you can modify the import statement in the `dependencies.py` file to use absolute imports instead of relative imports:

```python
# File: /workspace/fastapi-sqlalchemy-alembic-pytest-sample/app/dependencies.py

from app.database.session import SessionLocal
```

Make sure that your project structure is correctly set up, and that the `app` directory is recognized as a package. If `SessionLocal` is defined in `session.py` within the `database` directory, this absolute import should work correctly.

If you have other files with similar relative imports, you'll need to adjust those as well. This change should resolve the import error and allow your application to run without issues.
