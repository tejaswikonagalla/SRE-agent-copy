I'm sorry, but I need more context about the specific error message or the migration issue you're encountering. The error message "Migration failed" is quite generic, and without additional details about the error or the codebase, it's challenging to provide a precise solution. Could you provide more information or details about the error logs or the specific migration script that is failing?
