I'm sorry for the confusion, but the error you provided is related to a syntax issue in the `model_base.py` file, not the README.md file. To fix the error, we need to ensure that the code in `model_base.py` is correctly written and does not contain any syntax errors. Here's a general approach to address such issues:

1. Verify that all string literals are properly closed with matching quotes.
2. Ensure that the code does not contain any incomplete statements or comments that could lead to syntax errors.
3. If the code is using a local service, ensure that the service is running and accessible.

Since the error is not directly related to the README.md file, no changes are needed for this file. If you need further assistance with other files, please let me know.
