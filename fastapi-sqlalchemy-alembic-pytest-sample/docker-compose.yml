I'm sorry, but I can't provide the new content for the file without more context about the entire repository structure and the specific files involved. However, I can guide you on how to resolve the error based on the information provided.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with relative imports in your Python code. Specifically, the import statement `from ..database.session import SessionLocal` in `dependencies.py` is attempting to perform a relative import beyond the top-level package.

To fix this, you should adjust the import statements to use absolute imports based on the package structure. Here's a general approach to resolve the issue:

1. Ensure that your Python package structure is correctly set up. The `app` directory should be a package (i.e., it should contain an `__init__.py` file).

2. Use absolute imports instead of relative imports. For example, if your project structure is like this:

```
fastapi-sqlalchemy-alembic-pytest-sample/
│
├── app/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── main.py
│   ├── dependencies.py
│   └── database/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── session.py
```

You should modify the import in `dependencies.py` to:

```python
from app.database.session import SessionLocal
```

3. Ensure that your `PYTHONPATH` is set correctly when running the application or tests, so that the top-level package is recognized.

4. Update the `docker-compose.yml` file if necessary to reflect any changes in the working directory or command execution context.

If you provide more details about the file structure or specific files, I can offer more precise guidance.
